# CodeBall viewer

## How it works

It launches a server that listens on HTTP and socket.io. Then it opens a browser window and uses it to view the results.

## Controls

* Arrow keys - rotate
* W, S - zoom
* Space - stop playback
* Q, E - rewind, go forward
* Enter - go fullscreen

## Running

Requires node.js.

Download the source, unzip.

Go into the resulting folder and run `cd server; node index.js` from the command line.
